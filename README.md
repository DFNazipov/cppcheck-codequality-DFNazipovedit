# About

I wanted reports from CppCheck to be visable in GitLab Merge Requests as [Code
Quality reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html#implementing-a-custom-tool).
That's all this does, convert CppCheck XML to Code Quality JSON.

# Usage

Coming soon...

# ToDo

[ ] Project's `pylint` badge
[ ] Generate a badge with https://shields.io/ colors using [anybadge](https://pypi.org/project/anybadge/)
